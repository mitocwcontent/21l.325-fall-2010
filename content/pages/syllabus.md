Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

The "small wonders" to which our course will attend are moments of present time, depicted in the verbal and visual media of the modern age: newspapers, novels and stories, poems, photographs, films, etc. We will move between visual and verbal media across a considerable span of time, from eighteenth-century poetry and prose fiction to twenty-first century social networking and microblogging sites, and from - sculpture to photography, film, and digital visual media. With help from philosophers, contemporary cultural historians, and others, we will begin to think about a media practice largely taken for granted in our own moment.

It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgment for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work.

| 1 |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Augustine. "Time and Eternity." {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Using whatever media you have available in class today (pen and paper, chalk and blackboard, laptop, smartphone, etc.), take 5-10 minutes to document the present moment in time. What do you see and hear around you? What is the "atmosphere" like? What are you thinking and feeling at this moment? When you have finished, we will reflect on similarities and differences between accounts, and consider how and to what effect various media are used to record or evoke the passing present. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
